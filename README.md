Write a Java program to implement a Student Course Registration System.

Create a class named Student with the following data members: studentName, rollNumber, marks, courseName and courseCredits.

Create a parameterized constructor to initialize all the student and course details.

Implement the following methods:

calculateFee() - Calculate the course fee assuming Rs. 1500 per credit.
checkEligibility() - Return true if the student's marks are 50 or above; otherwise return false.
calculateScholarship() - Provide a 20% scholarship if marks are 85 or above, 10% scholarship if marks are between 70 and 84, and no scholarship otherwise.
calculateFinalFee() - Calculate the final fee after deducting the scholarship amount.
displayDetails() - Display student details, course details, eligibility, total fee, scholarship and final fee.
In the main() method, read the student and course details. Create an object using the parameterized constructor. First check whether the student is eligible for registration.

If the student is eligible, calculate the course fee, scholarship and final fee and display all the details. If the student is not eligible, display an appropriate message.

Use separate methods for each operation and ensure that the calculations are not performed directly inside main().
